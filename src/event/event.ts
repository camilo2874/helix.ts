/**
 * Event is a dictionary of information that provides useful context about an
 * event. An Event shall be present as much as possible when passing data across
 * services, allowing to better understand the origin of an event.
 *
 * helix integrations and services rely on Event to manage logs and traces across
 * services. It's up to the client on the front-end side to send an Event, when
 * applicable. This is mostly done in the Metadata of the Response object of the
 * REST router integration.
 *
 * Event should be used for data that you’re okay with potentially exposing to
 * anyone who inspects your network traffic. This is because it’s stored in HTTP
 * headers for distributed tracing. If your relevant network traffic is entirely
 * within your own network, then this caveat may not apply.
 *
 * This is heavily inspired by the following references, and was adapted to better
 * fit this ecosystem:
 *
 * - The Segment's Context described at:
 *   https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/#context
 * - The Elastic Common Schema described at:
 *   https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html
